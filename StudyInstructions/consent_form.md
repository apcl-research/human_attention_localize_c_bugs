# A Study of Programmers Behaviors in Identifying and Localizing Bugs

## Informed Consent Form

### Purpose of the Study:
This is a study in computer science conducted by Emory Smith, 
a PhD student in the University of Notre Dame. 
The purpose of this study is to find what programmers do when they identify and localize bugs.

What will be done:  
    You will:  
    1. Access an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with projects in C source code.  
    2. Read software bug descriptions.  
    3. Find the location of the bug in source code.  
    4. Answer questions about the bug, location, source code, and thought process.  
    5. The IDE will collect interaction data such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, 
    and an eye tracking device will track where you look on the screen during the 
    duration of the study.

We will analyze the data and find common patterns in the data.

The estimated duration of this study is two hours.

#### Benefits of this Study:

You will be contributing to knowledge of software engineering. 
In addition, we will pay $100 per hour.

#### Risks or discomforts:

No risks or discomforts are anticipated from taking part in this study. If you feel uncomfortable about this study, you can withdraw from the study. If you decide to quit at any time before you have finished, your answers will NOT be recorded.

#### Confidentiality:

Your results will be kept confidential.  
We will not release identifiable information. 
 We do intend to release eye tracking data in an aggregate, anonymous format.  
 We will ask you to include an e-mail address so that we can contact you for payment. 
 The list of e-mail of our participants will be stored electronically in a password protected folder.

#### Decision to quit at any time:

Your participation is voluntary; you are free to withdraw your participation from this 
study at any time. If you do not want to continue, you can simply exit the virtual machine 
and do not send your data to us. 

#### How the findings will be used:

The results of the study will be used for scholarly purposes only. 
The results from the study will be presented in educational settings and at 
professional conferences, and the results might be published in a professional journal in the field of computer science.
